# AutoDQM
AutoDQM parses DQM histograms and quickly identifies outliers for further analysis. AutoDQM's output can be easily parsed by eye on an AutoPlotter-powered html page, autogenerated when you run AutoDQM using the included bash script.

Example Output: http://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~jguiang/dqmGUI_test
AutoPlotter: http://github.com/jkguiang/AutoPlotter

## Using AutoDQM

###### Setup:
Clone this repository and move its contents to a public html directory. Currently AutoDQM relies on DIS technology (not included in this repository). This will be changed soon. Or, you can use any AutoDQM page that is publicly accessible.

###### Input:
1. You can enter your data sets into AutoDQM in one of two ways:
    1. By identifying parts of the full data set name - sample, CMSSW version, and processing version (see an AutoDQM page for an example)
    2. By the full data set name
2. Click the submit button.
3. After a response from the AutoDQM algorithm has been received, navigate to the 'plots' tab to view the results.
